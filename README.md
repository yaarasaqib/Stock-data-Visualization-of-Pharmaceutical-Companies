We all need medicine in some or more part of our lives, as humans we are always interested in gains of either material or spiritual.
We have extracted stock data on top 95 pharmaceutical companies based on their market cap. Our data contains 31 columns and 95 rows. We have tried to visualize these stock variables in our project.
We also have used some information from  Forbes List for the years 2021 and 2022.
We have tried to frame some interesting questions and answer them using possible visualizations.
We have also made interactive plots and visualizations using R Shiny App-

1.Pie Chart : This shows the pie chart of the type of the market cap i.e., it shows the percentage of the companies having large ,mid and small market capabilities(
  
2.Analysis Of Stock Variables :
  Here, all the stock variables are listed in the side bar panel, and upon clicking on any of them, we will get two see Barplot, Boxplot and a Histogram along with the summary of the chosen variable.
  We also have two types of colour options in the barplot and histogram, according to the type of market cap and the year of eastablishment
  The names of companies having the highest and lowest values of the chosen variable is also written below the barplot.default(
    
3.Yearly Sales Analysis :
  Here we can chose any number of years in the side bar panel to view boxplots, overlapped histogram and frequency polygon so that the sales of different years can be compared.

4.Comparison of Yearly Sales for Different Companies:
  Here, the left side bar panel contains the names of companies and the right side bar panel contains years.
  Upon choosing any number of companies, we get a line diagram for sales for each of those selected companies for all the years mentioned,
  helping us to compare companies on the basis of sales in these 10 years. On clicking any of the years,in the right side bar panel, the company having the highest and lowest sales among the selected companies for that particulat year comes up as a text.
